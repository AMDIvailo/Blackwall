# Blackwall 
This is a social network  
There are 3 main conceptions:  
  -<b>Wall</b>  
  -<b>Profile Wall</b>  
  -<b>Friends</b>  
  
The way they work:  
  All the posts from the <b>Profile Walls</b> of your <b>Friends</b> are visible from the <b>Wall</b>.  
  User can view his <b>Wall</b> to see the posts of his <b>Friends</b> or either see invidual <b>Profile Wall</b>   
  
To work properly, blackwall needs <a href="https://github.com/AMDIvailo/EasyAuth">EasyAuth</a>, which must be placed in the Blackwall root directory (./easyauth/)
